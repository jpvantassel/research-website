							<h2>Effectiveness of Distributed Acoustic Sensing for Acquiring Surface Wave Dispersion Data using Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a rapidly expanding tool to sense vibrations and system deformations
							in many engineering applications. In terms of site characterization, DAS presents the ability to make
							static and dynamic strain measurements on a scale (e.g., kilometers), density (e.g., meter-scale), and
							fidelity (e.g., microstrain) that was previously unattainable with traditional measurement technologies.
							In this study, we assess the effectiveness of using DAS to extract surface wave dispersion data using the
							multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) technique. We utilized both highly-controlled, broadband
							vibroseis shaker truck and more-variable, narrow-band sledgehammer sources to ex-cite the near surface and
							compared the DAS-derived dispersion data directly with concurrently acquired traditional geophone-derived
							dispersion data. We report that the differences between the two sensing approaches are minimal and well
							within the uncertainty bounds associated with each individual measurement for the following DAS testing
							conditions: (a) a tight-buffered or strain-sensing fiber optic cable is used, (b) the cable is buried in a
							shallow trench to enhance coupling, and (c) short gauge lengths and small channel separations are used. Our
							deployed conditions are more promising than previous attempts documented in the literature, thereby
							demonstrating that DAS can provide accurate measurements of sur-face wave dispersion data of the same
							quality as geophones. We show that frequency-dependent normalization of the dispersion image removes the
							effects of scaling, integration, and differentiation of the measured data, thereby removing the need to
							post-process the geophone-derived and DAS-derived waveforms into equivalent units before performing dispersion
							processing. Finally, we summarize the important effect of gauge length on the dispersion data for future
							reference. This study demonstrates that DAS, when appropriate considerations are made, can be used in-lieu
							of traditional sensors (i.e., geophones) for making high-quality measurements of surface wave dispersion
							data using the MASW technique.
