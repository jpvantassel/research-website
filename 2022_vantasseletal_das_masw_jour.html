							<h2>Extracting High-Resolution, Multi-Mode Surface Wave Dispersion Data
								from Distributed Acoustic Sensing Measurements
								using the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves
							</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a rapidly expanding tool to sense wave propagation and system
							deformations in many engineering applications. In terms of site characterization, DAS presents the
							ability to make static and dynamic strain measurements at scales (e.g., kilometers) and spatial
							resolutions (e.g., meters) that were previously unattainable with traditional measurement
							technologies. In this study, we rigorously assess the potential for extracting high-resolution,
							multi-mode surface wave dispersion data from DAS measurements using active-source multichannel
							analysis of surface waves (MASW). We have utilized both highly-controlled, broadband vibroseis
							shaker trucks and more-variable, narrow-band sledgehammer sources to excite the near surface,
							and compare the DAS-derived dispersion data obtained from both source types directly with
							concurrently acquired traditional geophone-derived dispersion data. We find that the differences
							between the two sensing approaches (i.e., DAS and geophones) are minimal and well within the
							dispersion uncertainty bounds associated with each individual measurement type when the following
							conditions are met for DAS: (a) a tight-buffered or strain-sensing fiber-optic cable is used, (b)
							the cable is buried in a shallow trench to enhance coupling, and (c) short gauge lengths and small
							channel separations are used. We also show that frequency-dependent normalization of the dispersion
							image following MASW processing removes the effects of scaling, integration, and differentiation on
							the measured waveforms, thereby allowing nearly identical dispersion data to be extracted from
							geophone waveforms (proportional to velocity) and DAS waveforms (proportional to strain) without
							requiring them to first be converted into equivalent units. We provide evidence that the short
							wavelength (high frequency) DAS dispersion measurements are limited by both the gauge length and
							the more commonly considered channel separation. We further show that it is possible to extract
							essentially equivalent surface wave dispersion data from seismic measurements made using a
							traditional geophone array or two different DAS cables. Finally, we show that shear wave velocity
							profiles recovered from the DAS data using an uncertainty-consistent, multi-mode inversion agree
							favorably with cone penetration tests performed at the site. This study demonstrates that DAS, when
							appropriate considerations are made, can be used in-lieu of traditional sensors (i.e., geophones) for
							making high-resolution, multi-mode measurements of surface wave dispersion data using the MASW
							technique.
