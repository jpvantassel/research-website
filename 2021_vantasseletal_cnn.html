							<h2>Using Convolutional Neural Networks to Develop Starting Models for 2D Full Waveform Inversion</h2>
						</header>
						<p>
							Non-invasive subsurface imaging using full waveform inversion (FWI) has the potential to fundamentally
							change engineering site characterization by enabling the recovery of high resolution 2D/3D maps of
							subsurface stiffness. Yet, the accuracy of FWI remains quite sensitive to the choice of the initial starting
							model due to the complexity and non-uniqueness of the inverse problem. In response, we present the novel
							application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to transform an experimental seismic wavefield acquired
							using a linear array of surface sensors directly into a robust starting model for 2D FWI. We begin by describing
							three key steps used for developing the CNN, which include: selection of a network architecture, development of
							a suitable training set, and performance of network training. The ability of the trained CNN to predict a suitable
							starting model for 2D FWI was compared against other commonly used starting models for a classic near-surface imaging
							problem; the identification of an undulating, two-layer, soil-bedrock interface. The CNN developed during this study
							was able to predict complex 2D subsurface images of the testing set directly from their seismic wavefields with an
							average mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 6%. When compared to other common approaches, the CNN approach was able to
							produce starting models with smaller seismic image and waveform misfits, both before and after FWI. The ability of
							the CNN to generalize to subsurface models which were dissimilar to the ones upon which it was trained was assessed
							using a more complex, three-layered model. While the predictive ability of the CNN was slightly reduced, it was still
							able to achieve seismic image and waveform misfits comparable to the other commonly used starting models. This study
							demonstrates that CNNs have great potential as a tool for developing good starting models for FWI, which are critical
							for producing accurate FWI results.
