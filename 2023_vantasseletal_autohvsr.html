						The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) of ambient noise has seen widespread use
                        as a tool for measuring a site's fundamental resonant frequency (f0). However, the processing
                        of HVSR with traditional methods can be tedious and time consuming, particularly when the HVSR
                        is complex and exhibits multiple resonances. This work proposes the AutoHVSR algorithm that
                        allows for the fully-automated processing of HVSR measurements including those with zero, one,
                        or multiple clear resonances. The AutoHVSR algorithm accepts seismic wave recordings and
                        user-defined HVSR processing parameters as input and returns the HVSR calculations, statistics
                        on the HVSR curve, and statistics on each automatically identified HVSR resonant frequency.
                        The AutoHVSR algorithm integrates robust signal processing and computational methods with
                        state-of-the-art machine-learning models trained using a diverse dataset of 1109 HVSR
                        measurements. The AutoHVSR algorithm demonstrates excellent performance by correctly
                        determining the number of HVSR resonances for 1099 of the 1109 HVSR measurements (>99%) and
                        predicting the mean resonant frequency of the correctly identified resonances with a root
                        mean square error (RMSE) of 0.05 Hz. Furthermore the AutoHVSR algorithm was able to produce
                        these predictions in 13 minutes compared to the 30 hours required for traditional processing
                        (a speed up of 138). The AutoHVSR algorithm is further demonstrated on a challenging dataset
                        from Canterbury, New Zealand that had been previously interpreted by a different group of
                        analysts (i.e., disjoint from those who produced the AutoHVSR training dataset) and with the
                        assistance of local geology and information about resonances identified nearby. Despite the
                        challenging nature of the dataset the AutoHVSR algorithm was capably of determining 104 of the
                        129 HVSR measurements and predicting the mean resonant frequency of the correctly identified
                        resonances with a RMSE below 0.05 Hz. Finally, while the AutoHVSR algorithm was developed
                        using ambient noise measurements where the horizontal components were combined using the
                        geometric mean it is shown to extend without modification to ambient noise HVSR measurements
                        where the two horizontal components are rotated azimuthally and to HVSR measurements from
                        small-strain earthquake ground motion recordings.
